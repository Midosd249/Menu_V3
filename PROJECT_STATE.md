## PH Lifecycle — Completed

PH-01 through PH-06 are completed historical milestones. No additional PH milestone is currently defined.

## PH-01 — Self-Serve Customer Lifecycle — CLOSED / VERIFIED / MERGED
PR: #170
Merge commit: `7e91778bfafa67b24efd1edf4387e1f3014fae9d`

### Customer lifecycle contract
- New customer: Home → Registration → secure workspace provisioning → Studio.
- New customers do not depend on a manual approval/request queue before entering the product.
- Existing customer: Home → Login → email OR phone + password → existing workspace / Studio.
- Platform Admin customer control remains centered on `/admin/users` and is server-authorized.
- Tenant and branch isolation, fail-closed provisioning, authentication, authorization, and server-side trust boundaries remain protected.

### Legacy retirement
- Legacy Leads / Service Requests are removed from the active Platform Admin customer lifecycle surface.
- The previous approval/request gating dependency was retired rather than merely hidden.
- Legacy request-record/trigger cleanup included in PR #170 is recorded as completed in the PR scope.
- No replacement approval queue was introduced.

### Platform Admin
- `/admin/users` remains the supported customer-control surface.
- Legacy Service Requests / Leads are not the customer lifecycle control surface.
- Admin navigation and route behavior were corrected and verified during the PR work.

### Verification
- VERIFIED BY MANUS REPORT: Quality gates passed for the final PH-01 batch.
- VERIFIED BY MANUS REPORT: W9 Orders QA passed.
- VERIFIED FROM GITHUB: merge commit is verified.
- Manus reported that a prior local TypeScript/baseUrl check failed because of a local toolchain/version mismatch; official CI was the authoritative quality gate for the merged batch.

## Production / Release Gates
- VERIFIED: GitHub `main` contains the PH-01 merge and protected prior work.
- VERIFIED: GitHub `main` now contains PR #172 homepage runtime fix.
- UNKNOWN: physical real-device Production QA for the latest `main`.
- UNKNOWN: current Production environment-variable values.
- BLOCKED / NON-BLOCKING: the PR #172 Vercel deployment attempt was rate-limited by the known free daily deployment quota; no retry was performed.
- Do not use Vercel as an iteration loop or trigger unnecessary deployment retries.

## Current Strategic Direction
The current Activation workstream is closed; the repository is awaiting the owner's next explicitly scoped task.

```text
Live Menu
→ Guest Experience
→ Menu Intelligence
→ Owner Intelligence
→ Growth Extensions
→ Experiments
→ Guest Relationships
→ Customer Self-Serve Lifecycle
→ Existing implemented commercial/admin capabilities
```

Do not turn the product into a generic AI chatbot, POS, accounting system, or autonomous restaurant operator.

## Continuity Rule
At the end of every atomic task:
1. reconcile Git head against GitHub `main`;
2. distinguish implementation, CI, deployment, and device evidence;
3. update continuity files when canonical state changes;
4. record exactly one next authorized task;
5. never infer authorization for deferred payment/commercial work.

## 2026-09-17 — Homepage Runtime Regression — CLOSED / VERIFIED
- VERIFIED: PR #172 fixed the public homepage `React.Children.only` crash.
- VERIFIED: root cause was multi-child `Button asChild` composition: `Link` plus trailing `ArrowUpLeft` icon.
- VERIFIED: `src/components/ui/button.tsx` now uses Radix `Slottable` for multi-child `asChild` composition.
- VERIFIED: `tests/public-pages-themes-contract.test.mjs` contains regression protection.
- VERIFIED: Quality run `35266109690` and W9 Orders QA `35266109691` passed.
- VERIFIED: merge commit is `8050d2f08a2904f5ee2d9085454c47bdba601392`.
- UNKNOWN: physical real-device Production QA for the latest main.
- Durable incident record: `docs/project-memory/2026-09-17-homepage-react-children-only.md`.

## A.1 — Customer Journey & Event Truth Audit — CLOSED / VERIFIED
- VERIFIED: audit completed against repository baseline `c3afb623559ea1d6e015a5abeb6a59ebc26a4f27` and live Supabase.
- VERIFIED: no runtime code, schema, auth/RLS, theme, or deployment changes were made.
- VERIFIED: audit: `docs/audits/2026-09-18-a1-customer-journey-event-truth-audit.md`.
- VERIFIED: A.2 implementation is on branch `feat/a2-minimal-journey-instrumentation-2026-09-18` at `75b191677a16c84240db609d6d920c02d66cb781`.
- VERIFIED: PR #191 is OPEN / DRAFT and targets `main`.
- VERIFIED: A.2 adds canonical `search`, `category_view`, and `add_to_cart` events to `menu_events` with tenant-scoped category validation/storage.
- VERIFIED: GitHub Quality run `35340567488` passed; W9 Orders QA run `35340567487` passed.
- VERIFIED: no production deployment or synthetic traffic was used.
- VERIFIED: remaining gaps are authoritative event → order linkage, cart-open measurement, and the existing `menu_events.session_id` nullability mismatch.
- BLOCKED: Supabase security advisor reports RLS disabled on six live tables; separate security task required.
- UNKNOWN: physical Production device QA, current Production environment values, sufficient real R6 exposure.

## A.2 — Minimal Journey Instrumentation — CLOSED / VERIFIED BY CI
- Scope was limited to search/category/add-to-cart measurement.
- Canonical `menu_events` was extended; no parallel analytics stream was introduced.
- Existing tenant/branch validation, product ownership validation, R6 experiment semantics, Owner Analytics, Growth, Reports, R2–R9, and public-menu architecture were preserved.
- Focused regression coverage was added for the server contract and all live public renderer families.
- Quality and W9 Orders CI passed on the final head.

## A.3 — Server-Controlled Anonymous Session → Order Attribution Design — CLOSED / VERIFIED
- VERIFIED: design completed against canonical repository code and A.2 state.
- VERIFIED: no runtime code, database migration, auth/RLS, theme, or deployment change was made.
- VERIFIED: recommended architecture is server-issued opaque anonymous session + tenant-bound server record + nullable `orders.anonymous_session_id`.
- VERIFIED: existing `menu_events` remains the canonical analytics stream.
- VERIFIED: existing order rate limiting and idempotency remain protected.
- PROPOSED: browser `localStorage` session must stop being authoritative.
- PROPOSED: historical events/orders remain intact and are not retroactively relinked.
- UNKNOWN: installed TanStack Start cookie API/version and any production cookie restrictions.
- BLOCKED: implementation requires explicit authorization.

## Exact Next Task
A.3 — Implement server-controlled anonymous session → order attribution. Implementation only; preserve the approved design and do not expand scope.
