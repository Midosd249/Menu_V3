## PH Lifecycle — Completed / Deferred Boundary

```text
PH-01 Self-Serve Registration → Workspace → Studio       DONE / VERIFIED / MERGED
PH-02 Customer Lifecycle Visibility                      DONE / VERIFIED / MERGED
PH-03 Subscription Plans + Paid 14-Day Trial             DONE / VERIFIED / MERGED
PH-04 Platform Admin Subscription & Account Control     DONE / VERIFIED / MERGED
PH-05 Invoice Generation + WhatsApp Sharing              DONE / VERIFIED / MERGED
PH-06 Commercial Activation                               DONE / VERIFIED / MERGED

Payment Provider Integration                              NOT STARTED / DEFERRED
Commercial Launch                                         NOT STARTED / DEFERRED
```

The owner has explicitly decided NOT to implement Payment Provider Integration or Commercial Launch now. Do not create a PH-07 placeholder and do not start either deferred area without explicit authorization.

## PH-01 — Self-Serve Customer Lifecycle — CLOSED / VERIFIED / MERGED

PR #170 — `fix: retire legacy customer approval and request flows`

Merge commit:
`7e91778bfafa67b24efd1edf4387e1f3014fae9d`

### Final contract
- New customer: Home → Registration → secure workspace provisioning → Studio.
- Existing customer: Home → Login → email OR phone + password → existing workspace / Studio.
- New customer access no longer depends on manual approval/request gating.
- `/admin/users` remains the server-authorized customer-control surface.
- Legacy Leads and Service Requests are retired from the active lifecycle/admin surface.
- Tenant isolation, branch isolation, server authorization, fail-closed provisioning, and security boundaries remain protected.

### Documentation / verification provenance
- GitHub directly verifies PR #170 merged at `7e91778...`.
- Manus reported successful repository Quality gates, W9 Orders QA, and Vercel deployment for the completed batch.
- A local TypeScript/baseUrl check was reported by Manus as a local toolchain/version mismatch; official CI was the authoritative quality gate for the merged implementation.

## Homepage Runtime Fix — CLOSED / VERIFIED

PR #172 — `fix: prevent homepage React.Children.only crash`

- Root cause: `Button asChild` received a `Link` plus a sibling `ArrowUpLeft` icon; Radix Slot requires `Slottable` for this multi-child composition pattern.
- Fix: `src/components/ui/button.tsx` now preserves the first child as the slotted interactive element and preserves trailing sibling content using `Slottable`.
- Regression protection: `tests/public-pages-themes-contract.test.mjs` verifies the homepage pattern and Button `Slottable` contract.
- VERIFIED: Quality run `35266109690` passed typecheck, full tests, lint, production build, public all-theme browser QA, Studio browser QA, Platform Admin browser QA, performance/diagnostic stages, and cleanup.
- VERIFIED: W9 Orders QA run `35266109691` passed.
- VERIFIED: merge commit `8050d2f08a2904f5ee2d9085454c47bdba601392` is on `main`.
- UNKNOWN: physical real-device Production QA for the latest `main`.

## R10
STATUS: DEFERRED / NOT STARTED.

Do not begin R10 without explicit authorization.

## Production / Release Readiness
- VERIFIED: repository-side product work through PH-06 plus the homepage runtime fix is present in `main`.
- UNKNOWN: physical Android/iOS production QA.
- UNKNOWN: current production environment-variable values.
- Do not use Vercel as the development iteration loop.

## Product Direction
Menu V3 remains a premium Arabic-first restaurant platform:

```text
Live Menu
→ Guest Experience
→ Menu Intelligence
→ Owner Intelligence
→ Growth Extensions
→ Experiments
→ Guest Relationships
→ Self-Serve Customer Lifecycle
```

The product is intentionally paused before payment-provider integration and commercial launch.

## Exact Next Task
Await the owner's next explicitly scoped task. No payment provider work, commercial-launch work, or PH-07 work is authorized by this plan.


## 2026-09-18 — Platform Admin Customer Notifications

- VERIFIED: current main = 8939474e705459e7e5757d93b053593a2ee1d4b2.
- VERIFIED: direct self-serve signup is active; new customers are provisioned into their workspace without the retired approval/request queue.
- VERIFIED: /admin/orders remains a real operational order-management surface and is separate from customer onboarding.
- IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS: Platform Admin new-customer notification center is being added on branch feat/platform-new-customer-notifications.
- Scope: notification bell + unread badge + in-app toast + recent customers + optional browser notifications, backed by server-authorized polling.
- Not in scope: Supabase Realtime migration, push infrastructure, customer lifecycle redesign, order removal, payment-provider work, commercial launch, or PH-07.
- Exact next task: verify the focused notification change, create the PR, and stop before unrelated work.
