## R5 — Growth Extensions
STATUS: CLOSED / VERIFIED

- Deterministic distribution action for published zero-activity menus.
- Uses existing OwnerAnalytics evidence and verified publication state.
- Reuses `/studio/brand`; no duplicate dashboard or route.
- No fabricated metrics or autonomous messaging.

## R6 — Experiments
STATUS: CLOSED / VERIFIED — ACTIVATION COMPLETE; OUTCOME PENDING REAL EXPOSURE

- Experiment: `whatsapp-cta-v1`.
- Stable `control` / `prominent` assignment from existing anonymous session id.
- Server derives the stored variant.
- Published menus with configured WhatsApp only.
- Existing `menu_events` remains canonical through nullable experiment fields.
- Preview/owner-preview does not activate or record the experiment.
- Primary: WhatsApp-click sessions / exposed sessions.
- Guardrail: product-view sessions / exposed sessions.
- Collection target: 50 exposed sessions per variant.
- Directional interpretation only; no statistical significance claim.

## AI Infrastructure
- VERIFIED: server-side provider abstraction.
- VERIFIED: structured routing for Inception/Mercury, Gemini, Z.AI, OpenRouter, and xKiro.
- VERIFIED: multimodal routing for Gemini, OpenRouter, Z.AI, and xKiro.
- VERIFIED: schema validation, rate limiting, prompt-injection safeguards, and human-review boundaries.
- VERIFIED: server-only credentials.

## Release-Only Vercel Policy
Normal path:

**LOCAL DEVELOPMENT → LOCAL QA → LOCAL BROWSER / VISUAL QA → TESTS → GITHUB ACTIONS QUALITY GATES → DIFF REVIEW → ONE COHERENT RELEASE BATCH → MERGE TO MAIN → ONE VERCEL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT → REAL-DEVICE PRODUCTION QA → RECORD RESULT**

Do not use Vercel as the normal development loop. Do not infer production state from GitHub or HTTP 200. Do not randomly retry quota/rate/build failures.

## Current Release State
- VERIFIED: latest code is merged to `main` at `42b67382d3e1f1c3d66ed8fd8ba582101cf7da7a`.
- BLOCKED: latest Vercel production deployment must be verified separately because the account has a deployment/build-rate limit condition.
- UNKNOWN: direct physical-device production QA is unavailable through the current connector environment.

## Current Strategic Direction
```text
Live Menu
→ Guest Experience
→ Menu Intelligence
→ Owner Intelligence
→ Growth Extensions
→ Experiments
```

## Exact Next Task
### R7 — Post-Experiment Evidence Review / Controlled Optimization

After real R6 exposure accumulates, inspect canonical `menu_events` experiment fields and determine whether the evidence supports keeping control, keeping treatment, or ending the experiment. Do not claim statistical significance without sufficient data. Do not start a second experiment before this review.

## Continuity Rule
At the end of every atomic task:
1. reconcile current Git head;
2. verify CI evidence;
3. verify deployment separately when relevant;
4. update `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `TASKS.md`;
5. update material audit/research/project-memory records when the task reveals a durable lesson;
6. record exactly one next task;
7. stop.
