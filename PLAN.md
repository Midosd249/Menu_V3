## R5 — Growth Extensions
STATUS: CLOSED / VERIFIED

- Deterministic distribution action for published zero-activity menus.
- Uses existing OwnerAnalytics evidence and verified publication state.
- Reuses `/studio/brand`; no duplicate dashboard or route.
- No fabricated metrics or autonomous messaging.

## R6 — Experiments
STATUS: CLOSED / VERIFIED — ACTIVATION COMPLETE; OUTCOME PENDING REAL EXPOSURE

- Experiment: `whatsapp-cta-v1`.
- Stable `control` / `prominent` assignment from existing anonymous session id.
- Server derives the recorded variant.
- Participation is limited to published menus with configured WhatsApp.
- Existing `menu_events` remains canonical through nullable experiment fields.
- Preview/owner-preview does not activate or record the experiment.
- Primary: WhatsApp-click sessions / exposed sessions.
- Guardrail: product-view sessions / exposed sessions.
- Collection target: 50 exposed sessions per variant.
- Directional interpretation only; no statistical significance claim.

## R7 — Initial Evidence Review
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS — NON-BLOCKING / INSUFFICIENT EXPOSURE

- VERIFIED: canonical table is `menu_v3.menu_events`.
- VERIFIED: current observed exposure remains 1 distinct `control` session and 2 distinct `prominent` sessions.
- VERIFIED: no treatment decision is justified; continue eligible real exposure.
- VERIFIED: no synthetic traffic is used and no statistical significance claim is made.

## R8 — Closed-Loop Menu Growth Engine
STATUS: CLOSED / VERIFIED / MERGED

- VERIFIED: `/studio/growth` provides the unified owner-facing Observe → Act → Measure surface.
- VERIFIED: recommendations are deterministic and evidence-bound.
- VERIFIED: thin traffic is treated as insufficient evidence.
- VERIFIED: recommendations route to existing supported Studio destinations; no automatic menu mutation.
- VERIFIED: R8.1–R8.5 are complete and protected.

## R9 — Guest Relationships
STATUS: CLOSED / VERIFIED / MERGED

- VERIFIED: PR #136 merged the R9 guest relationship batch.
- VERIFIED: owner-facing Studio guest relationship surface covers Guest CRM, Loyalty, Campaigns, Feedback, and Retention.
- VERIFIED: relationship data is server-authorized and tenant/branch scoped; owner/admin are the elevated roles used by the existing permission contract.
- VERIFIED: loyalty accounts and ledger, owner-controlled campaign drafts, and feedback records have RLS enabled and public access revoked.
- VERIFIED: retention and relationship overview are derived from existing guest/order data; no synthetic evidence is introduced.
- VERIFIED: autonomous outbound messaging, automatic rewards, autonomous campaign execution, predictive claims, and pricing mutation are excluded.
- VERIFIED: prior quality run 1453 passed the configured route generation, typecheck, tests, lint, build, Playwright and browser-quality stages.

## R10
STATUS: DEFERRED / NOT STARTED

R10 is intentionally not started. Do not begin R10 until the owner explicitly authorizes it.

## AI Infrastructure
- VERIFIED: server-side provider abstraction.
- VERIFIED: structured routing for Inception/Mercury, Gemini, Z.AI, OpenRouter, and xKiro.
- VERIFIED: multimodal routing for Gemini, OpenRouter, Z.AI, and xKiro.
- VERIFIED: schema validation, rate limiting, prompt-injection safeguards, and human-review boundaries.
- VERIFIED: server-only credentials.

## Production / Commercial Readiness
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS — EXTERNAL EVIDENCE REMAINING

- VERIFIED: repository-side R9 implementation and CI quality gates are complete.
- VERIFIED: GitHub `main` contains the protected product work.
- UNKNOWN: direct current Vercel Production environment-variable values.
- UNKNOWN: current Production deployment commit/state requires direct Vercel evidence.
- UNKNOWN: physical real-device Production QA.
- BLOCKED: unnecessary Vercel deployment retries must not be attempted while the known free daily deployment quota is exhausted.

## Release-Only Vercel Policy
Normal path:

**LOCAL DEVELOPMENT → LOCAL QA → LOCAL BROWSER / VISUAL QA → TESTS → GITHUB ACTIONS QUALITY GATES → DIFF REVIEW → ONE COHERENT RELEASE BATCH → MERGE TO MAIN → ONE VERCEL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT → REAL-DEVICE PRODUCTION QA → RECORD RESULT**

Do not use Vercel as the normal development loop. Do not infer production state from GitHub or HTTP 200. Do not randomly retry quota/rate/build failures.

## Current Release State
- VERIFIED: `main` is `9995848b747bdb238e45b7ed6fe6b551c6779fcc`.
- VERIFIED: the latest main commit was directly fetched from GitHub.
- UNKNOWN: direct current Vercel Production deployment state and environment configuration.
- UNKNOWN: physical real-device Production QA.

## W7 — Internal Product Experience Architecture
STATUS: W7.1 COMPLETE / W7.2 NOT STARTED

- VERIFIED: W7.1 audited current Studio/Admin source architecture against main SHA `9995848b747bdb238e45b7ed6fe6b551c6779fcc`.
- VERIFIED: W7.1 deliverables were added on working branch `w7-1-ia-audit`: `docs/W7_SOURCE_SWEEP.md`, `docs/W7_1_IA_AUDIT.md`, `docs/W7_1_ROUTE_MAP.md`, `docs/W7_1_WIREFRAMES.md`.
- VERIFIED: `/admin` is a tab-driven monolith with 12 tabs/pseudo-routes.
- VERIFIED: `/studio/growth` and `/studio/guests` source routes exist but are absent from the checked-in generated route tree; this requires local route-generation verification before W7.2.
- INFERRED: primary internal UX debt is information architecture/discoverability, not missing backend capabilities.
- PROPOSED: internal workspace hierarchy = Home, Menu, Orders, Growth, Customers, Settings; Appearance and Publishing are consolidated subdomains.
- PROPOSED: desktop grouped navigation and a dedicated mobile bottom navigation of Home, Menu, Orders, Growth, More.
- PROPOSED: side panels for contextual entity inspection and full pages for dense tables/long forms/analytics.
- BLOCKED: Mobbin direct connected inspection was unavailable/paid; no inaccessible evidence was used.

### W7.2 Entry Criteria
1. Regenerate/verify TanStack route tree locally and explain the `growth`/`guests` mismatch.
2. Review `docs/W7_1_ROUTE_MAP.md` against current route generation and permission contracts.
3. Implement only the shared internal shell/IA changes necessary for the approved W7.2 scope.
4. Run relevant tests, typecheck, lint, build, RTL/mobile and accessibility checks.
5. Stop before any production deployment.

## Exact Next Task
### W7.2 — Internal Experience Shell and Navigation

**WAITING FOR EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL.** Do not start W7.2 until the user explicitly approves W7.1.

R7 remains active independently. R10 remains deferred and untouched.

## Session Log — 2026-09-14 — W7.1 IA Audit
- VERIFIED: repository-first W7.1 research completed from current `main` at `9995848b747bdb238e45b7ed6fe6b551c6779fcc`.
- VERIFIED: external research covered shadcn Sidebar, Radix accessibility/RTL, Tailwind logical properties, NN/G IA/mobile guidance, WCAG 2.2, Toast Orders/Menu reports, Square menu management, SaaSFrame side panels/patterns, Dribbble visual references, and Refine GitHub reference material.
- VERIFIED: no new dependency or framework was added.
- VERIFIED: no UI code, route code, database, RLS, auth, subscription, deployment or merge occurred.
- VERIFIED: W7.1 deliverables are architecture/reference documents only.
- UNKNOWN: live browser/device rendering of the current internal shell; W7.1 did not perform browser QA.
- BLOCKED: Mobbin direct MCP access was unavailable/paid.

## Continuity Rule
At the end of every atomic task:
1. reconcile current Git head;
2. verify CI evidence;
3. verify deployment separately when relevant;
4. update `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `TASKS.md`;
5. update material audit/research/project-memory records when the task reveals a durable lesson;
6. record exactly one next task;
7. stop.
