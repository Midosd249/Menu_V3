## PH Lifecycle — Completed

## PH-01 — CLOSED / VERIFIED / MERGED

PR #170: `fix: retire legacy customer approval and request flows`

Merge commit: `7e91778bfafa67b24efd1edf4387e1f3014fae9d`

### Acceptance state
- New customer: Home → Registration → secure workspace provisioning → Studio.
- Existing customer: Home → Login → email OR phone + password → existing workspace / Studio.
- New customers no longer depend on manual approval/request gating.
- `/admin/users` remains the server-authorized customer-control surface.
- Legacy Leads and Service Requests are retired from the active Platform Admin lifecycle surface.
- Tenant/branch isolation, fail-closed provisioning, auth, authorization, and server-side trust boundaries remain protected.

### Verification provenance
- GitHub confirms PR #170 merged into `main` at `7e91778...`.
- Manus reported successful Quality and W9 Orders QA gates.
- Manus reported the remaining local TypeScript/baseUrl check was a local toolchain/version mismatch rather than an application failure.

PR #172: `fix: prevent homepage React.Children.only crash`

Merge commit: `8050d2f08a2904f5ee2d9085454c47bdba601392`

### Acceptance state
- Public homepage signup CTAs no longer crash when `Button asChild` contains a Link plus an icon.
- Radix `Slottable` keeps the Link as the slotted interactive element while preserving sibling content.
- Regression contract covers the homepage multi-child `asChild` pattern.
- No backend, database, authentication, RLS, tenant isolation, pricing, theme renderer, or deployment configuration changes were introduced.
